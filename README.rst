Answer to-What_happens_when_your_type_google_com_in_your_browser_and_press_enterðŸ˜Š???

When you enter "www.google.com" into your browser's address bar and press enter, a series of steps take place:
1.DNS Resolution:
The browser first checks its local cache to see if it already knows the IP address for "www.google.com". If it has a cached entry that is still valid, it will use that IP address directly.
If the IP address is not found in the cache, the browser sends a DNS request to a DNS resolver, which is often provided by your ISP or a third-party DNS service.
The DNS resolver begins the process of finding the IP address by querying authoritative DNS servers. It starts by contacting the root DNS servers to find the servers responsible for the top-level domain (TLD) ".com".
The root servers respond with the IP addresses of the TLD's authoritative servers. The resolver then queries these servers to find the authoritative DNS servers for "google.com".
Finally, the resolver queries the authoritative servers for "google.com" to get the IP address for "www.google.com".
2.Response to Browser:
The DNS resolver sends the IP address for "www.google.com" back to the browser.
3.TCP Connection:
The browser establishes a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) connection to the IP address on port 80 for HTTP or port 443 for HTTPS. Google uses HTTPS, so the connection is on port 443.
4.HTTP Request:
The browser sends an HTTP GET request to the server at "www.google.com". This request includes headers with information like the user agent and any cookies.
5.Server Processing:
The server at "www.google.com" processes the request. For Google, this involves running search algorithms and preparing the search results page.
6.HTTP Response:
The server sends back an HTTP response containing the requested content, such as the Google search results page. This response includes headers with status codes, content type, and content length.
7.Content Rendering:
The browser receives the response and starts rendering the content. It parses the HTML, applies CSS styles, executes JavaScript, and displays the page.
8.Additional Requests:
The browser may need to make additional requests for resources like images, scripts, or stylesheets referenced in the HTML. It repeats the connection and request steps for each resource.
9.Page Load Completion:
Once all resources are fetched and rendered, the page finishes loading, and you can interact with it.
